/*
Brief description of Boid Class:
//The boid class creates an object which has multiple vectors (location, velocity, acceleration)
//Boids are given certain properties and rules to follow when interacting with other boids.
//They are being used to simulate flocking patterns and properties

For predators:
Predators should act by themselves. Thus, their maxSpeed should be different,
and they should not adhere to the three laws. However, they should adhere to
cohesion -- how should they seek prey? Also, prey should be able to run away
from predators. There are several ways to do this. The easiest way:

	Predators are part of the flock. This means that when the boids check
	through the vector of other boids, the predators are included. Check if
	the boid being looked at is a predator, and if it is, calculate a Pvector
	that maximizes separation.
